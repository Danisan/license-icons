## About

Icons and logos from various vendors of the coding community.

This project just provides icons from various licenses. All icons are made available through the following dimensions (in pixels):

* 16x16
* 32x32
* 48x48
* 64x64
* 96x96
* 128x128
* 256x256


## CSS spritesheets

You can insert the icons directly into your HTML with a common IMG tag:

```html
<img alt="Github logo" src="dist/32x32/mit.png" width="32" height="32">
```


In addition to the icons by themselves, this project also ships a CSS spritesheet for the icon-pack. This spritesheet allows to load the entire icon-pack in just 1 image, and thus reduce HTTP calls.

This is what it actually looks:

![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t1st3/license-icons/master/dist/sprite-32x32/license-icons.png)
![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t1st3/license-icons/master/dist/sprite-16x16/license-icons.png)


All the positioning of the icons inside this alone image is made through CSS, which allows you to just add block-type tags with the proper class and get the same result:

```html
<div class="license-icons mit"></div>
```

Just remember to add the CSS stylesheet to the HEAD of your HTML page!


## Install

### Get the package with NPM

> npm install license-icons


### Get the package with Bower

> bower install license-icons


### Get the package with Composer / Packagist

> composer require t1st3/license-icons


### Get the package with NuGet

> Install-Package license-icons


## Build the whole project or your custom project

We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the project, so if you want to re-build or customize this project, you'll need Gulp.

After gulp is installed, and your CLI is pointed to your work directory, first install the dependencies:

**with NPM 2.x.x**

> npm install

**with NPM 3.x.x** (resolve dependencies for `node-spritesheet` before this module's ones)

> npm install grunt grunt-contrib-coffee grunt-contrib-clean

> npm install

then be sure that you have *[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)* installed for building spritesheet.

then, you can run the `gulp build` task to build the project:

> gulp build


### What the build task does?

First, it takes PNG files from the `src` folder, and pastes them to the `dist` folder.

Then it creates a spritesheet from the PNG images located in the `src` folder, and thus creates the `sprite` folder in `dist`.

If, for example you just want `bsd` and `mit` icons in a spritesheet, you just have to fork this project, point your CLI to the working directory, 
empty the `src` directory, except `bsd` and `mit` icons in PNG format, and then run the `gulp build` task.

You'll get the proper spritesheet and copies of the icons directly in the `dist` folder.


## License

Each icon in this project belong to its original author, and for most of them, they are copyrighted. Some of these icons may not match their project's official icon/logo.

Actually, this icon set is quite opinionated, but is definitely open to improvements, or critics.

Please note that the project "license-icons" does not consider these icons as free-to-use by default: 
if you want to use these icons in your project, you may|shall|should|must check with the rightful owners that your use of the icon is OK.
