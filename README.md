About
--------

Icons and logos from various vendors of the coding community.


This project just provides icons from various licenses. All icons are made available through the following dimensions (in pixels):

* 16x16
* 32x32
* 48x48
* 64x64
* 96x96
* 128x128
* 256x256


CSS spritesheets
----------

You can insert the icons directly into your HTML with a common IMG tag:

```
    <img alt="Github logo" src="dist/32x32/mit.png" width="32" height="32">
```


In addition to the icons by themselves, this project also ships a CSS spritesheet for the icon-pack. This spritesheet allows to load the entire icon-pack in just 1 image, and thus reduce HTTP calls.

This is what it actually looks:

![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T1st3/license-icons/master/dist/sprite-32x32/license-icons.png)
![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T1st3/license-icons/master/dist/sprite-16x16/license-icons.png)


All the positioning of the icons inside this alone image is made through CSS, which allows you to just add block-type tags with the proper class and get the same result:

```
    <div class="license-icons mit"></div>
```

Just remember to add the CSS stylesheet to the HEAD of your HTML page!
